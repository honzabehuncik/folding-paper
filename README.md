# Folding-paper

The goal of this project was to create an algorithm that would solve **how many times we need to fold a paper to make its distance match the distance of the Moon from the Earth**. At the same time, other paper formats were included in the project so that the differences between them could be easily compared. It was also important to see if this would be possible in the real world.

## Used tools
The program was written in C# using other libraries such as System, System.Collections.Generic and the Math library.

## Future of the project
In the future, the program could be extended with a **UI** or some interactive simulation explaining the problem.
